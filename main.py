                            \n1. After I took my test in 2023 and came home, I looked again at the questions I remembered. I realized that the test wasn't as hard as people make it seem.
                            \n2. First, I printed out all the questions from 2000 to 2022. Then I looked at them to see which ones were easy and which were hard. I didn't actually solve them, just looked.
                            \n3. Then, I made a list of all the stuff I needed to learn. I decided not to join any special classes because I didn't want to spend money, and those classes only care about making money, not helping students.
                            \n4. So, I started looking for free ways to learn. I found videos on YouTube from places like MIT, HARVARD, and FREECODECAMP, and other free stuff from schools.
                            \n5. I also read a lot on Wikipedia and watched lectures from NPTEL. Some people say those lectures are no good, but I think they're great because they're made by top-notch IIT professors. It's funny because we all want to go to IITs but then complain that their lectures are boring and not helpful. Where's the sense in that?
                                 We've formed a mindset that recognizes the abundance of outstanding resources available to us, yet we still feel compelled to gravitate towards coaching centers. We shy away from exploring our subjects independently and hesitate to unleash our full potential.
                            \n6. For some subjects, I read books like CLRS for DS ALGO, but I only focused on the important parts.
                            \n7. To get better at math, I went back to my old school books from grades 11 and 12.
                            \n8. I studied every subject and practiced by solving old test questions. If I didn't understand something, I looked it up on Wikipedia or asked ChatGPT for help.
                            \n9. By the end of August, I had learned most of what I needed to know. I didn't worry about learning everything, just the important stuff. I practiced by doing old test questions from the Byjus exam prep website.
                            \n10. Then, whenever I found something new, I learned about it and made sure to review everything I learned every day.
                            \nThat's pretty much it.

### Key Points to Save Time
- **Stop Wasting Time**: Avoid unproductive activities like unnecessary socializing or bunking classes.
- **Complete College Work in College**: Finish assignments and study during college hours to free up time for GATE prep later.
- **Avoid Extra Burden**: Don‚Äôt take on additional responsibilities that can add stress.
- **Skip Unnecessary Lectures**: If possible, skip lectures that don't add value to your GATE preparation or college understanding.

### Additional Tips
- **Set a Consistent Routine**: Establish a daily study schedule that balances both college work and GATE prep.
- **Use Technology**: Utilize online resources and apps for efficient GATE study.
- **Prioritize Important Tasks**: Focus on high-yield topics crucial for both college exams and GATE.
- **Balanced Lifestyle**: Include relaxation and leisure activities to avoid burnout.

By following these strategies, you can effectively manage your time and excel in both college studies and GATE preparation. Stay organized, focused, and consistent.
